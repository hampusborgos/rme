		name is the name that's displayed in the UI for this version.

		otb is what otb file it uses (see above). More than one client
		using the same otb version WILL NOT WORK

		Tag the ones that can be selected in the UI with visible

		Tag the ONE that is the default when the editor opens up on the
		first time with default="true"

		otbm - There can be multiple otbm subtags, list what map version
		that client version uses. If multiple, set one as default="true"
		and the editor will use that one as the default for new maps.
		Otherwise the first one will be preferred.

		extensions - Tag with range of extensions that version should load.
		If you set it for to=8.20 for example, all made extension for 8.20
		and later will be loaded

		data - The .dat / .spr id (first four bytes). Used to recognize
		the client data files. The format is what version
		of the loader the editor should use (ie. last time data format
		changed)
